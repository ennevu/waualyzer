# WAUalyzer

Wappalyzer Augmented is an augmentation of the famous and now closed-source Wappalyzer.

A fork that adds support for extracting additional metadata fields, including the Favicon hash. This version remains fully backward compatible with the original Wappalyzer functionality while providing extended analysis capabilities.
